## Energy Analysis

To probe the energetic origin of sequence-dependent self-assembly behavior, we computed short-range interchain and chain–water Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic interaction energies for all ELP–linker–tag systems. For each variant, these interaction energies were normalized relative to the corresponding energies of the ELP–Car9 reference system using:

```math
E_{\text{relative}} = \frac{E_{\text{ELP–Car9}} - E_{\text{ELP–tag}}}{E_{\text{ELP–Car9}}} \times 100\%
```

This relative energy comparison enables direct assessment of how sequence modifications alter the balance between chain–chain and chain–water interactions with respect to the Car9 baseline, providing a consistent energetic framework for comparing self-association and hydration tendencies across all systems.
